# Metric & Imperial Length Units Conversion Tool
To save Metric kids like me who lives in an Imperial world, or Imperial kids who need to work with Metric system.

* You will need to have Python 3 installed.
* Run .py file in Mac OS.
* Change file extension to .pyw on Windows platform. This will tell Python on Windows to run without invoking the command prompt.
* .py and .pyw files only differ in file extensions, not in actual codes, changing extensions won't break the app.
* Unzip, double-click to run. Enjoy!

UI may look awkward on platforms other than Mac OS or Windows, for I have not tested on such platforms.
Let me know if there are any issues, I'd be happy to debug.
