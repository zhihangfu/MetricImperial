# MetricImperial
To save Metric kids like me who lives in an Imperial world, or Imperial kids who need to work with Metric system.

* You will need to have Python 3 installed.
* .py file is for Mac and others.
* .pyw is for Windows.
* Unzip, double-click to run. Enjoy!

UI may look awkward on platforms other than Mac OS and Windows, for I have not tested on such platforms.
Let me know if there are any issues, I'll be happy to debug.

Version 2:
1. added a new line of units: pitch & pixel for assessing screen products. 

Version 3:

2. disabled input into “pixel”
3. added “clear” button
