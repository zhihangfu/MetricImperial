# MetricImperial
To save Metric kids like me who lives in an Imperial world, or Imperial kids who need to by Metric products.

You will need to have Python 3 installed.
.py file is for Mac and others.
.pyw is for Windows.

UI may look awkward on platforms other than Mac OS and Windows, for I have not tested on such platforms.
Let me know if there are any issues, I'll be happy to debug.
